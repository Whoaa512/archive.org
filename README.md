#archive.org

The goal of this project is to create a clone of [archive.org](http://archive.org/). The starting code is an empty node server with the `http` module. Basic requirements for this included:
* Routing and handling `HTTP` requests.
* Creating a second node process for fetching submitted websites, to be run on an interval cron job.
* Interfacing with SQL DB using the `Sequelize` npm package.


This is an automated copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from the [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum.  For technical reasons, the history has been omitted, and my code is mixed with that of my pair and the exercise's starting point.  As such, this repo is representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled, but not of my solo work.  For a better perspective on my own work, see [Hive](https://github.com/Whoaa512/Hive).
